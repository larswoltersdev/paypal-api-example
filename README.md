# Laravel 6 PayPal REST API Webstore

For a long time, I’ve been looking how to make a reliable, simple but efficient webstore with PayPal integration in Laravel. After discovering how, I instantly presented mine to senior developers and the Laravel community, that granted alot of useful feedback. Now, I’d love to share with the world how to make what took me long to figure out.

This repository contains a dynamic webstore, order-payment-product database schema, fully functional shopping cart and complete PayPal REST API integration.
